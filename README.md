### Development

If you'd like to fork your own version, sign up for an API key
[here](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html).

Place the key in a file at `src/api-key.js` with a default export:

```javascript
export default 'your-key-here'
```

To start local development:

```
npm run dev
```

To create a minified build:

```
npm run build
```
